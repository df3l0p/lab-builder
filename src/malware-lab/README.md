# Malware Lab

## Description

This repository provides basic vagrant configuration and scripts to build a simple malware analysis lab.

## Requirements

This labs requires the boxes from the [Build Boxes](https://github.com/df3l0p/build-boxes) project for the Windows part, and an Internet connection for the download of the Kali box and the different tools at build time.

## Features

Currently, only two machines are available:

- kali (light version): run inetsim as a sinkhole
- win10-64: Windows 10 64 bits machine for running malwares

On windows machines, all tools located in "resources/tools" are copied into c:\tools. This is done as when disconnecting NAT interface during malware analysis, the c:\vagrant share may not be available.
When started, the machine will retrieve network configuration from the kali VM.
